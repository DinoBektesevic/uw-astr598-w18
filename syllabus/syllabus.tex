{\bf Learning Goals:}
This course will introduce graduate students to most common statistical and computer science methods 
used in astronomy and other physical sciences. It will combine theoretical background with 
examples of data analysis based on modern astronomical datasets. Practical data analysis 
will be done using python tools, such as astroML module (see www.astroML.org). 
While focused on astronomy, this course should be useful to all graduate students interested in data 
analysis in physical sciences and engineering. The lectures will be aimed at graduate 
students and the main discussion topics will be based on Chapters 3-5, and selected 
topics from Chapters 6-10, from the reference textbook. 

By taking this course, students will develop working knowledge of topics such as robust 
statistics, hypothesis testing, maximum likelihood analysis, Bayesian statistics, model 
parameter estimation, the goodness of fit and model selection, density estimation and 
clustering, unsupervised and supervised classification, dimensionality reduction, 
regression and time series analysis. Most of these topics will be applied in class 
homeworks and projects to analysis of astronomical data. 

\vskip 0.2in
{\bf Prerequisites:}
The students taking this class are required to have taken basic calculus and statistics, 
to have knowledge of scientific measurements at the level of a senior lab (in science 
or engineering), as well as to have basic python skills. 

\vskip 0.2in
{\bf Lecture format:}
After a few introductory lectures, new material will be introduced on a schedule that 
will enable independent student work on a publication-quality class project.
